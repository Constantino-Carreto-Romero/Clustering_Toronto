# Clustering of Neighborhoods in Toronto

In this project I cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto according to the their most common venues. To obtain the necessary data I use web scrapping to get postal codes in Toronto and then use the Foursquare API to get the venues in each neighborhood. Then I use k-means clustering.

This project is my assignment for the [Capstone Project Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone/) 's week 3 evaluation.
